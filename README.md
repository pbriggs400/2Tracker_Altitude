# 2Tracker_Altitude
A portable calculator for laptop, notebook, android using the FAI method of 2 trackers to find rocket altitude with indication of closure.
Model rockets fly to altitude leaving a smoke trail after boost then a marker trail at apogee. If the trackers can get a close reading
of the angle of elevation from their position the result is said to be "closed". Otherwise the trackers have taken readings at different times, or other inaccuracies have crept into the process. Not "closed". 
The calculation used is to get a distance between trackers, and using the 2 angles of azimuth calculate the third angle beta. Then beta is used to calculate the real distance on the ground to the point under the rocket at apogee. Tan ratio is used to calculate the 2 elevations above the ground point.

Sources of error: There are many, starting with the trackers themselves. If you have a larger model rocket you can use an altimeter, but this
adds weight to the rocket. Extra weight is a penalty when FAI competition is on the line, and altitude is the object for a given rocket motor.
Model rocketry people are welcome to use.
Tested on PC (Windows 10), Android.
Suggestions are welcome.
